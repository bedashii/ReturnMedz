Version 3.5 - 20-01-2009 - João Massena <jpmassena@gmail.com>
**********************************************************
	1- New result mode. Now, when you search for a title, and IMDb returns a list of results, a window will
	be opened with a list of those results. The sections parsed are popular titles, approx matches, exact matches and partial matches.
	Then you may choose one of those and only the choosed one will be parsed;
	
	2- There is no longer the need of threads;
	
	3- There is no more XML involved. The search results are represented as a list of IMDbLink and the title's informations are represented
	as a IMDbTitle object, that holds all the fields for each title. There's also the objects IMDbActor (represents an actor with its infos),
	IMDbDirCrea (represents a director or a creator), IMDbSerieEpisode (represents an episode of a serie) and IMDbSerieSeason (represents a 
	season of a serie);
	
	4- Character field parsing was added for the actors;
	
	5- The parsing is now done with strong regular expressions, without using string functions as substring;
	
	6- You don't need anymore to implement an error or progress listener to get those informations from the API if you don't want them.

Version 3.1 - xx-xx-xxxx - João Massena <jpmassena@gmail.com>
**********************************************************
	1- It is possible to parse episodes's information (name, first air date, plot) from all or just some seasons of the
	   TV series;
	
	2- All the communication between the api and the form are event based;
	
	3- The results are transmitted in a XML document loaded on memory;
	
	4- The test form is improved with a richtextbox for the results display;
	
	5- Implemented a manager that is responsable to check what kind of page we get. The form only is used to pass the options
	and the queries to the api and to display the results.
